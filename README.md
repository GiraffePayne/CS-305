# CS-305

The client for this project is known as Artemis Financial. The client requested we create a financial service for 
their consumers to have different plans according to their specific needs. They were also looking to improve their security
by incorporating the industries best practices into their work. This was to ensure information was being tranfered through
a secure channel their consumers can trust. For this to be achieved, it was necessary that code was developed in a
manner in which security was in the forefront of our minds. Without a high-level of security, it is very difficult
to ask a consumer to trust a company. By having good security, it allows the consumer to trust the company with the
sensitive information they are sharing. The most difficult portion I had was with false positives. I had a few
other errors here and there like setting up my check sum, but overall, I had a pleasant time wdeveloping the
applications for Artemis Financial. Creating the SSL certificate was also a pleasant experience. 

To ensure the project I had developed was secure, it was crucial that I ran it several times to ensure I got all the
dependency checks I needed and didn't miss any key information. I had a few issues with Eclipse, like how any time
I closed Eclipse, I had to repair the file system to open it again, which I feel led to more frustration when working
on projects. But besides that I would like to utilize the web browser in Eclipse more to allow for more productivity.
